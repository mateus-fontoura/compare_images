# Image Comparison Script :camera:
This Python script fetches an image from a URL(Usually Azion post process from IMS) and compares it to a reference image(Origin original image). It repeats this process multiple times and creates a mosaic image of all the fetched images side by side to be compared manually or not, It will add an "X" in the middle of the image if its different in the Mosaic.
